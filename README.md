IRC-Server
==========
This is a prototype IRC server, written in Java. It's very crude because I have almost no knowledge of IRC whatsoever,
but I'll be workin on it, slowly but firmly. The only way to learn something is to jump straight into it! This server is basically a combination of guessing IRC protocols and imitating irc.mibbit.net. 

Using the server
================
I don't have a pre-compiled source, so you'll have to compile it yourself. The source is a working Eclipse project, you just need to import it. The server hosts IRC on port 6667, so if you're planning to have people connect from outisde you LAN, make sure to port forward that.
